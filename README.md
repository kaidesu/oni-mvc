Tengu Framework
===============

Tengu Framework is an opensource (MIT) MVC framework with the intention of being a learning platform for budding PHP developers.

Tengu initially started out as a no-name MVC framework for my own personal learning endeavor. I've learned quite a bit since first starting, picking things up here and there from other tutorials and methods I've come across working with other PHP frameworks (CodeIgniter, FuelPHP).

Nothing here is new or orginal in a sense. It's been done many times over (and more than likely better than what I can do right now), but that still doesn't change the fact that it's a great learning experience for stepping into real OOP PHP development.

The intention of this is not to release yet another PHP MVC framework out into the wild. There are many great options to choose from if you're looking to kickstart your project (I personally love FuelPHP). Again, the intention of this is to teach. This will be a part of a series of tutorials that I'm working on that will go over some fundamental concepts within development for those of you wishing to take your development beyond creating basic spaghetti-code websites/applications.

Conventions
-----------
The main thing I wanted to do with this, is to create a framework that followed some of the standards that have risen within the PHP community.

* PHP >=5.3
* Composer
* PSR-1 Compliant
* PSR-2 Compliant (Getting there...)
* PSR-3 Compliant (Utilizes Monolog to handle logging)
* PSR-4 Compliant (Utilizes Composer's autoloader)

Installation
------------
Simply run `php composer.phar install` from the root of your installation and you'll be good to go!
