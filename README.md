Tengu Framework
===============
The main thing I wanted to do with this, is to create a framework that followed some of the standards that have risen within the PHP community, while also learning and applying some best practices.

Conventions
-----------
* PHP >=5.3
* Composer
* PSR-1 Compliant
* PSR-2 Compliant (Getting there...)
* PSR-3 Compliant (Utilizes Monolog to handle logging)
* PSR-4 Compliant (Utilizes Composer's autoloader)

Installation
------------
Simply run `php composer.phar install` from the root of your installation and you'll be good to go!
